They did a Google search to see who could paint refinery equipment like this, and that’s how they found us.” According to Mike John, Jr., the on-site project manager on the Laurel job and vice president of all gas pipeline and oil refinery projects, a prior coating on the heater’s steel substrate was flaking off—and corrosion had already taken place. As a result, CHS needed an imminent high-temperature coating solution. However, the complication was that because of the heater’s importance to the refinery and the client’s desire to keep the unit operational and without any downtime, this was far from an ordinary coatings application. “Temperatures during the day reached 90 °F [32.2 °C], and the heater had a surface temperature of 400 °F [204.4 °C],” John recalls. “There were a lot of hazards.

"<p>The corrosion of water-and-steam systems of power-generating units during shutdown has adverse impacts, such as damaging the equipment and increasing maintenance costs, seriously affecting the safe and stable operation of the units. A common method to solve this problem is applying corrosion inhibitors, such as octadecylamine and imidazoline, to form protective layers on the metal surface before shutdown. The problem is that these inhibitors can only form hydrophobic films on the metal surface at high temperatures and could do nothing to the equipment operating at low temperatures, such as condensate systems. Therefore, thermal equipment during shutdown calls for inhibitors that can directly protect carbon steel from corrosion in deionized water at lower temperatures.  </p>"

"<p>Based an hour outside of Buffalo in Olean, New York, M J Painting Contractor Corp. is 1,800 miles (2,896.8 km) away from the 60,000-bpd CHS refinery in Laurel, Montana. But in this modern tale, when CHS needed a facelift for its massive crude oil heater, all it took was one Google search to bridge that gap. “They were searching for a bit to find someone capable of doing it,” says Pete Dandrea, sales manager at M J Painting, which lists prior refining clients on its web site. “They were happy they found someone that could pull it off. They did a Google search to see who could paint refinery equipment like this, and that’s how they found us.” According to Mike John, Jr., the on-site project manager on the Laurel job and vice president of all gas pipeline and oil refinery projects, a prior coating on the heater’s steel substrate was flaking off—and corrosion had already taken place. As a result, CHS needed an imminent high-temperature coating solution. However, the complication was that because of the heater’s importance to the refinery and the client’s desire to keep the unit operational and without any downtime, this was far from an ordinary coatings application. “Temperatures during the day reached 90 °F [32.2 °C], and the heater had a surface temperature of 400 °F [204.4 °C],” John recalls. “There were a lot of hazards. I traveled on site to meet with the client beforehand and reviewed all the particulars. We met all their insurance and safety requirements, and with our training, they gave us the opportunity.”  </p>"

"<p>The corrosion of water-and-steam systems of power-generating units during shutdown has adverse impacts, such as damaging the equipment and increasing maintenance costs, seriously affecting the safe and stable operation of the units. A common method to solve this problem is applying corrosion inhibitors, such as octadecylamine and imidazoline, to form protective layers on the metal surface before shutdown. The problem is that these inhibitors can only form hydrophobic films on the metal surface at high temperatures and could do nothing to the equipment operating at low temperatures, such as condensate systems. Therefore, thermal equipment during shutdown calls for inhibitors that can directly protect carbon steel from corrosion in deionized water at lower temperatures.  </p>"

"<p>Thermochemical surface hardening is used to overcome the weak mechanical performance of austenitic and duplex stainless steels. Both low-temperature carburizing and nitrocarburizing can improve the hardness, wear, galling, and cavitation resistance, while maintaining their good corrosion resistance. Therefore, it is crucial to not form chromium-rich precipitates during hardening as these can deteriorate the passivity of the alloy. The hardening parameters, the chemical composition of the steel, and the manufacturing route of a component determine whether precipitates are formed. This article gives an overview of suitable alloys for low-temperature surface hardening and the performance under corrosive loading.  </p>"
"<p>Reinforced concrete towers in a water reservoir contain equipment to control water. Interruption in the operation of these towers causes a huge disruption in the municipal water distribution system. Operation in an aggressive environment contributes to corrosion.

"<p>The corrosion rates were investigated for carbon steel (CS) and Cr-containing steel exposed in water saturated with supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) for 96 h with different contents of impurities. The results showed that carbon monoxide (CO) had nearly no effect on the corrosion rates of CS and Cr-containing steel in all cases. As the content of impurities increased, the corrosion rate of CS increased in both oxygen (O2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) environments, while for the Cr-containing steel the rate decreased in the presence of O2 and increased under H2S conditions.  </p>"
"<p>Organic amines are used as a neutralizer to minimize the amine hydrochloride- induced corrosion in refinery overhead systems. The partition of active ingredients of the neutralizers to the hydrocarbon phase reduces the efficiency of neutralizing amines. Moreover, the partitioning of amines to the hydrocarbon phase can form amine chloride salts leading to underdeposit corrosion. In the present investigation, the authors selected eight organic amines commonly used in the refinery industry. Cyclohexylamine was found to be the most hydrophobic amine, whereas ethylene diamine was the most hydrophilic amine under the simulated refinery condition.  </p>"

"<p>Based an hour outside of Buffalo in Olean, New York, M J Painting Contractor Corp. is 1,800 miles (2,896.8 km) away from the 60,000-bpd CHS refinery in Laurel, Montana. But in this modern tale, when CHS needed a facelift for its massive crude oil heater, all it took was one Google search to bridge that gap. “They were searching for a bit to find someone capable of doing it,” says Pete Dandrea, sales manager at M J Painting, which lists prior refining clients on its web site. “They were happy they found someone that could pull it off. They did a Google search to see who could paint refinery equipment like this, and that’s how they found us.” According to Mike John, Jr., the on-site project manager on the Laurel job and vice president of all gas pipeline and oil refinery projects, a prior coating on the heater’s steel substrate was flaking off—and corrosion had already taken place. As a result, CHS needed an imminent high-temperature coating solution. However, the complication was that because of the heater’s importance to the refinery and the client’s desire to keep the unit operational and without any downtime, this was far from an ordinary coatings application. “Temperatures during the day reached 90 °F [32.2 °C], and the heater had a surface temperature of 400 °F [204.4 °C],” John recalls. “There were a lot of hazards. I traveled on site to meet with the client beforehand and reviewed all the particulars. We met all their insurance and safety requirements, and with our training, they gave us the opportunity.”  </p>"

"<p>The corrosion of water-and-steam systems of power-generating units during shutdown has adverse impacts, such as damaging the equipment and increasing maintenance costs, seriously affecting the safe and stable operation of the units. A common method to solve this problem is applying corrosion inhibitors, such as octadecylamine and imidazoline, to form protective layers on the metal surface before shutdown. The problem is that these inhibitors can only form hydrophobic films on the metal surface at high temperatures and could do nothing to the equipment operating at low temperatures, such as condensate systems. Therefore, thermal equipment during shutdown calls for inhibitors that can directly protect carbon steel from corrosion in deionized water at lower temperatures.  </p>"
"<p>Ammonia flue gas desulfurization (AFGD) has many advantages, but often it cannot work to its full capacity due to corrosion, especially pitting corrosion.

Results showed that serious pitting corrosion was observed on Q235 steel, Types 304 and 316 stainless steel (SS) (UNS S30400 and UNS S31600), and titanium alloy TA0, which was caused by an ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4] slurry containing a large amount of chloride and fluoride ions, and so they were not suitable for uninhibited AFGD application. No pits were observed on 2205 duplex SS (UNS S32205), 2507 super duplex SS (UNS S32750), and Hastelloy C-276 (UNS N10276) after six months.  </p>"

"<p>The durability design of new structures at the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) is currently performed based on environmental classification of structures’ sites. Bridge substructure and superstructure environments can be classified as slightly, moderately, or extremely aggressive according to the FDOT Structures Design Guidelines. Each classification requires prerequisites regarding concrete composition and concrete cover. The limitation of this durability design approach is that the actual achievable service life remains unknown. However, full-probabilistic service life models for predicting the service life in cases of chloride-induced reinforcement corrosion are available. Based on those, this article presents a selected benchmark of the durability design of Florida bridges.  </p>"
"<p>Reinforced concrete exposed to chloride can have severe corrosion. When repairs are made, steel in the repair location often becomes a cathode to the surrounding steel, resulting in corrosion of the bars in the concrete near the patch. One means to mitigate the acceleration of corrosion in the areas surrounding the patch is to embed sacrificial anodes into the patch, which provide corrosion control to the steel near the patch, as well as steel in the patch. This article describes the performance of a zinc-based embedded sacrificial anode. The results show that the sacrificial anode evaluated significantly reduced corrosion. </p>"

The freezing resistance of the rice husk mortar was improved greatly. The resistance to sulfate wet-dry cycle attack and the sulfate attack resistance coefficient of the rice husk mortar were increased. </p>"
<p>The present trend in establishing an effective level of external metallic surface corrosion control is the application of a barrier coating or adhesive on the metallic surface prior to the application of a thermal insulating material. Experience has shown that there is generally a limited beneficial effect from the application of cathodic protection (CP) to a bare or ineffectively coated metallic surface under thermal insulation. This NACE technical committee report was prepared as an information guide for external corrosion control of thermally insulated underground metallic surfaces and considerations of the effectiveness of CP. </p>

"<p>Thermochemical surface hardening is used to overcome the weak mechanical performance of austenitic and duplex stainless steels. Both low-temperature carburizing and nitrocarburizing can improve the hardness, wear, galling, and cavitation resistance, while maintaining their good corrosion resistance. Therefore, it is crucial to not form chromium-rich precipitates during hardening as these can deteriorate the passivity of the alloy. The hardening parameters, the chemical composition of the steel, and the manufacturing route of a component determine whether precipitates are formed. This article gives an overview of suitable alloys for low-temperature surface hardening and the performance under corrosive loading.  </p>"

<p> The corrosion behavior of 3Cr steel in static and dynamic water-saturated supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) systems during carbon capture and storage transport was investigated in this study. The results showed that the average and localized corrosion rates of 3Cr steel under static conditions were higher than those under dynamic conditions. Localized corrosion was the dominant corrosion type for 3Cr steel in the supercritical CO2 system. The corrosion product scale of 3Cr steel primarily consisted of two layers: the outer ferrous carbonate (FeCO3) crystalline layer and the inner layer comprised of chromium hydroxide [Cr(OH)3] and FeCO3.  </p>

"<p>Organic amines are used as a neutralizer to minimize the amine hydrochloride- induced corrosion in refinery overhead systems. The partition of active ingredients of the neutralizers to the hydrocarbon phase reduces the efficiency of neutralizing amines. Moreover, the partitioning of amines to the hydrocarbon phase can form amine chloride salts leading to underdeposit corrosion. In the present investigation, the authors selected eight organic amines commonly used in the refinery industry.

"<p>Based an hour outside of Buffalo in Olean, New York, M J Painting Contractor Corp. is 1,800 miles (2,896.8 km) away from the 60,000-bpd CHS refinery in Laurel, Montana. But in this modern tale, when CHS needed a facelift for its massive crude oil heater, all it took was one Google search to bridge that gap. “They were searching for a bit to find someone capable of doing it,” says Pete Dandrea, sales manager at M J Painting, which lists prior refining clients on its web site. “They were happy they found someone that could pull it off. They did a Google search to see who could paint refinery equipment like this, and that’s how they found us.” According to Mike John, Jr., the on-site project manager on the Laurel job and vice president of all gas pipeline and oil refinery projects, a prior coating on the heater’s steel substrate was flaking off—and corrosion had already taken place. As a result, CHS needed an imminent high-temperature coating solution. However, the complication was that because of the heater’s importance to the refinery and the client’s desire to keep the unit operational and without any downtime, this was far from an ordinary coatings application. “Temperatures during the day reached 90 °F [32.2 °C], and the heater had a surface temperature of 400 °F [204.4 °C],” John recalls. “There were a lot of hazards. I traveled on site to meet with the client beforehand and reviewed all the particulars. We met all their insurance and safety requirements, and with our training, they gave us the opportunity.”  </p>"

"<p>The corrosion of water-and-steam systems of power-generating units during shutdown has adverse impacts, such as damaging the equipment and increasing maintenance costs, seriously affecting the safe and stable operation of the units. A common method to solve this problem is applying corrosion inhibitors, such as octadecylamine and imidazoline, to form protective layers on the metal surface before shutdown. The problem is that these inhibitors can only form hydrophobic films on the metal surface at high temperatures and could do nothing to the equipment operating at low temperatures, such as condensate systems. Therefore, thermal equipment during shutdown calls for inhibitors that can directly protect carbon steel from corrosion in deionized water at lower temperatures.  </p>"

According to test temperatures ranging from 30 to 80 °C, the oxide film at temperatures from 60 to 70 °C only slightly dissolves, protecting the underlying metallic aluminum from further corrosion by gravimetric stability with almost no aluminum in the water solution. At temperatures &lt;60 °C, the oxide film cannot be observed with the naked eye, or the oxide film does not have good anticorrosion performance, while the oxide film shows greater dissolution with temperatures &gt; 70 °C.  </p>"

<p> The corrosion behavior of 3Cr steel in static and dynamic water-saturated supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) systems during carbon capture and storage transport was investigated in this study. The results showed that the average and localized corrosion rates of 3Cr steel under static conditions were higher than those under dynamic conditions. Localized corrosion was the dominant corrosion type for 3Cr steel in the supercritical CO2 system. The corrosion product scale of 3Cr steel primarily consisted of two layers: the outer ferrous carbonate (FeCO3) crystalline layer and the inner layer comprised of chromium hydroxide [Cr(OH)3] and FeCO3.  </p>
"<p>This article discusses the failure investigation performed for a major operator in the Middle East on duplex stainless steel (DSS) flowline welds. The subject flowline was used intermittently since 1984 in an extreme sour service chloride- containing corrosive environment. Inspection performed during 2016 identified pitting corrosion at the weld root and heat-affected zones. With the DSS prevalent “fit and forget” philosophy under scrutiny, a root cause analysis was performed. Detailed metallurgical, chemical, and mechanical testing and analysis revealed the actual cause of the failure, with subsequent inspection and repair procedures recommended for the other flowlines in the network with the same history.  </p>"
"<p>With the continuing high demand for fossil fuels, such as crude oil and natural gas, most of the current oil fields globally are getting older and even deeper. This trend raises the bar on innovating new protective fusion-bonded epoxy (FBE) coatings that meet and withstand the critical deep seawater extraction and transmission of previously unconventional petroleum products. This article provides an overview of high glass transition temperature FBE coating properties and performance in terms of flexibility, pull-off adhesion, cathodic disbondment, impact resistance, chemical resistance, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy required testing for high-temperature pipelines that operate up to 155 °C.  </p>"
"<p>To improve the corrosion resistance of the grounding grids in saline-alkali soil, the authors fabricated a conductive and anticorrosive coating. After a series of tests, the results indicated that the increase of the nickel powder in the coating can lead to its electrical conductivity enhancement. As the salt concentration in the solution increases, the impedance of the coating decreases. It was found that with the nickel powder content being ~20%, a good balance is achieved between the electrical conductivity and the corrosion resistance of the coating.   </p>"
"<p>Two of three subsea manifolds failed to hold hydrotest pressure during commissioning. Leaks were traced to compact flange hub connections joining multiphase flow meters (MPFMs) to manifold piping. Visual examination following recovery of the MPFMs revealed crevice corrosion of the A182 F51 22Cr duplex stainless steel hub and the UNS N07750 gasket. The water treatment strategy failed to control corrosion by seawater, which entered the manifold during deployment and remained inside for six months during wet parking prior to commissioning. Common alloys used for subsea connections were tested for resistance to crevice corrosion.  </p>"

"<p>Soil-side corrosion of aboveground storage tank (AST) bottoms is a major challenge. ASTs typically include active cathodic protection (CP) systems to mitigate soil-side corrosion of the bottoms. CP systems could fail, leading to unprotected tank bottoms, and sometimes corrosion could occur even with active CP. A study was conducted to determine efficacy of the vapor corrosion inhibitor (VCI) technology in mitigating corrosion. VCIs were found to be effective in mitigating corrosion when recommended dosages are used and could also be used in combination with impressed current CP systems. Overall, VCI technology was found to be a viable corrosion control measure.  </p>"
"<p>Modified rice husk ash (RHA) concrete was prepared by adding different RHA dosages at different temperatures into cementitious composites. The durability of the binders was characterized using a freeze-thaw test, coupled with compressive strength and weight loss testing and a permeability resistance test. The microstructure of modified concrete was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Because of freezing and thawing, the compressive strength and weight loss ratios of the modified concrete were decreased compared with the control concrete. The experimental data revealed that the permeability resistance of the modified concrete was higher with the introduction of RHA. The SEM analysis indicates the behavior modification mechanism.   </p>"

"<p>The corrosion rates were investigated for carbon steel (CS) and Cr-containing steel exposed in water saturated with supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) for 96 h with different contents of impurities. The results showed that carbon monoxide (CO) had nearly no effect on the corrosion rates of CS and Cr-containing steel in all cases. As the content of impurities increased, the corrosion rate of CS increased in both oxygen (O2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) environments, while for the Cr-containing steel the rate decreased in the presence of O2 and increased under H2S conditions.  </p>"
"<p>Organic amines are used as a neutralizer to minimize the amine hydrochloride- induced corrosion in refinery overhead systems. The partition of active ingredients of the neutralizers to the hydrocarbon phase reduces the efficiency of neutralizing amines. Moreover, the partitioning of amines to the hydrocarbon phase can form amine chloride salts leading to underdeposit corrosion. In the present investigation, the authors selected eight organic amines commonly used in the refinery industry. Cyclohexylamine was found to be the most hydrophobic amine, whereas ethylene diamine was the most hydrophilic amine under the simulated refinery condition.  </p>"

The results showed that these coatings exhibit high hardness and that nanostructured Co-3 wt% P, amorphous Ni-5 wt% P, and Co-10 wt% P coatings displayed satisfactory resistance to crevice and pitting attacks. The improved hardness and corrosion resistance make nanostructured Co-3 wt% P, amorphous NiP, and CoP coatings ideal candidates for protective and hard facing applications.  </p>"
"<p>Based an hour outside of Buffalo in Olean, New York, M J Painting Contractor Corp. is 1,800 miles (2,896.8 km) away from the 60,000-bpd CHS refinery in Laurel, Montana. But in this modern tale, when CHS needed a facelift for its massive crude oil heater, all it took was one Google search to bridge that gap. “They were searching for a bit to find someone capable of doing it,” says Pete Dandrea, sales manager at M J Painting, which lists prior refining clients on its web site. “They were happy they found someone that could pull it off. They did a Google search to see who could paint refinery equipment like this, and that’s how they found us.” According to Mike John, Jr., the on-site project manager on the Laurel job and vice president of all gas pipeline and oil refinery projects, a prior coating on the heater’s steel substrate was flaking off—and corrosion had already taken place. As a result, CHS needed an imminent high-temperature coating solution. However, the complication was that because of the heater’s importance to the refinery and the client’s desire to keep the unit operational and without any downtime, this was far from an ordinary coatings application. “Temperatures during the day reached 90 °F [32.2 °C], and the heater had a surface temperature of 400 °F [204.4 °C],” John recalls. “There were a lot of hazards. I traveled on site to meet with the client beforehand and reviewed all the particulars. We met all their insurance and safety requirements, and with our training, they gave us the opportunity.”  </p>"

"<p>The corrosion of water-and-steam systems of power-generating units during shutdown has adverse impacts, such as damaging the equipment and increasing maintenance costs, seriously affecting the safe and stable operation of the units. A common method to solve this problem is applying corrosion inhibitors, such as octadecylamine and imidazoline, to form protective layers on the metal surface before shutdown. The problem is that these inhibitors can only form hydrophobic films on the metal surface at high temperatures and could do nothing to the equipment operating at low temperatures, such as condensate systems. Therefore, thermal equipment during shutdown calls for inhibitors that can directly protect carbon steel from corrosion in deionized water at lower temperatures.  </p>"
"<p>Ammonia flue gas desulfurization (AFGD) has many advantages, but often it cannot work to its full capacity due to corrosion, especially pitting corrosion.

<p> The corrosion behavior of 3Cr steel in static and dynamic water-saturated supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) systems during carbon capture and storage transport was investigated in this study. The results showed that the average and localized corrosion rates of 3Cr steel under static conditions were higher than those under dynamic conditions. Localized corrosion was the dominant corrosion type for 3Cr steel in the supercritical CO2 system. The corrosion product scale of 3Cr steel primarily consisted of two layers: the outer ferrous carbonate (FeCO3) crystalline layer and the inner layer comprised of chromium hydroxide [Cr(OH)3] and FeCO3.  </p>

Next, this information is integrated and analyzed to assess whether biotic or abiotic processes were responsible for the failure. While the ability to diagnose MIC in the oil and gas industry is improving, practical limitations associated with sample collection in remote locations or from inside pipelines still present challenges to conclusively determine the cause.  </p>"

"<p>Based an hour outside of Buffalo in Olean, New York, M J Painting Contractor Corp. is 1,800 miles (2,896.8 km) away from the 60,000-bpd CHS refinery in Laurel, Montana. But in this modern tale, when CHS needed a facelift for its massive crude oil heater, all it took was one Google search to bridge that gap. “They were searching for a bit to find someone capable of doing it,” says Pete Dandrea, sales manager at M J Painting, which lists prior refining clients on its web site. “They were happy they found someone that could pull it off. They did a Google search to see who could paint refinery equipment like this, and that’s how they found us.” According to Mike John, Jr., the on-site project manager on the Laurel job and vice president of all gas pipeline and oil refinery projects, a prior coating on the heater’s steel substrate was flaking off—and corrosion had already taken place. As a result, CHS needed an imminent high-temperature coating solution. However, the complication was that because of the heater’s importance to the refinery and the client’s desire to keep the unit operational and without any downtime, this was far from an ordinary coatings application. “Temperatures during the day reached 90 °F [32.2 °C], and the heater had a surface temperature of 400 °F [204.4 °C],” John recalls. “There were a lot of hazards. I traveled on site to meet with the client beforehand and reviewed all the particulars. We met all their insurance and safety requirements, and with our training, they gave us the opportunity.”  </p>"

"<p>The corrosion of water-and-steam systems of power-generating units during shutdown has adverse impacts, such as damaging the equipment and increasing maintenance costs, seriously affecting the safe and stable operation of the units. A common method to solve this problem is applying corrosion inhibitors, such as octadecylamine and imidazoline, to form protective layers on the metal surface before shutdown. The problem is that these inhibitors can only form hydrophobic films on the metal surface at high temperatures and could do nothing to the equipment operating at low temperatures, such as condensate systems. Therefore, thermal equipment during shutdown calls for inhibitors that can directly protect carbon steel from corrosion in deionized water at lower temperatures.  </p>"

"<p>This article describes using physical vapor deposition (PVD) coatings to provide corrosion protection for metallic substrates. Historically, the corrosion protection offered by PVD coatings has been inadequate due to the presence of defects in the coatings, including macroparticles, flakes, pores, and the porous columnar structure of the coatings. However, a modified PVD coating process was introduced that produces coatings containing a much lower number of macroparticles and other defects, thereby significantly improving corrosion resistance. A case study is presented where a CrN coating produced by the novel PVD process was used by the U.S. Army to replace conventional plated coatings. </p>"

"<p>Thermochemical surface hardening is used to overcome the weak mechanical performance of austenitic and duplex stainless steels. Both low-temperature carburizing and nitrocarburizing can improve the hardness, wear, galling, and cavitation resistance, while maintaining their good corrosion resistance. Therefore, it is crucial to not form chromium-rich precipitates during hardening as these can deteriorate the passivity of the alloy. The hardening parameters, the chemical composition of the steel, and the manufacturing route of a component determine whether precipitates are formed. This article gives an overview of suitable alloys for low-temperature surface hardening and the performance under corrosive loading.  </p>"

<p> The corrosion behavior of 3Cr steel in static and dynamic water-saturated supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) systems during carbon capture and storage transport was investigated in this study. The results showed that the average and localized corrosion rates of 3Cr steel under static conditions were higher than those under dynamic conditions. Localized corrosion was the dominant corrosion type for 3Cr steel in the supercritical CO2 system. The corrosion product scale of 3Cr steel primarily consisted of two layers: the outer ferrous carbonate (FeCO3) crystalline layer and the inner layer comprised of chromium hydroxide [Cr(OH)3] and FeCO3.  </p>
